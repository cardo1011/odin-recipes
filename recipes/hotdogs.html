<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  I got this grownup hot dog recipe from a girl I attend church with. They were
  always gone in no time at family functions. You need to let them sit for a day
  or two to take on the flavor, and inexpensive hot dogs are key here.... they
  make a better product!

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 cup ketchup</li>
  <li>1 cup bourbon</li>
  <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>

</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>

  <li>
    Combine ketchup, bourbon, and brown sugar in a saucepan over medium heat.

    simmer for 1 hour.
